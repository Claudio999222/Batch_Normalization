# Batch Normalization in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview

This notebook explores the implementation and impact of Batch Normalization in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Batch Normalization is a technique that normalizes the input of each layer to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, which helps improve the training speed and stability of neural networks.

## Key Objectives:

1. **Introduction to Batch Normalization**: Understand the concept of Batch Normalization and its benefits.

2. **Implementation in CNNs with Keras**: Learn how to apply Batch Normalization to convolutional layers in CNNs using the Keras framework.

3. **Effect on Training Speed**: Observe how Batch Normalization accelerates the training convergence of the model.

4. **Stability and Generalization**: Explore how Batch Normalization contributes to the stability of training and enhances the generalization capabilities of CNNs.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the CNN model with Batch Normalization on test data.

## Considerations:

- Batch Normalization is often applied after the convolutional and dense layers, before the activation function.
- It introduces additional learnable parameters (gamma and beta) for scaling and shifting normalized values.
- Batch Normalization can act as a regularizer, reducing the need for other regularization techniques.

This notebook serves as a practical guide to implementing Batch Normalization in CNNs, highlighting its advantages in terms of training speed, stability, and generalization.
